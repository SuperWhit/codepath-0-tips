Notes:
I still have one bug I would like to fix in the app, however I am not sure how to check if the keyboard is currently being shown. My bug is, if the user  enters an amount, then dismisses the keyboard, then tries to adjust the tip percentage the tip view slides up. This is being called because it is going into my catch-all onEditingChanged() function, although I only want the view to animate when I am editing the text field (Thus the keyboard is up)

I spent some time figuring out how to change the status bar color to white, finally found the info.plist file to change ‘View controller-based status bar appearance’ to ‘NO’ which fixed my problem.
